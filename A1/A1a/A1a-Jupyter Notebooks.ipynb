    "### Setting up your Jupyter Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will be completing your assignments primarily in a jupyter notebook, which provides an interactive development environment that allows you to write code, equations, visualizations, and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "You first task is to setup a jupyter notebook environment on your system.  As a default starting point, I would recommend installing anaconda ([the individual edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)) and then jupyterlab (see [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous other installation possibilities, but all you need is to be able to create jupyter notebooks and write code in either python or julia.  The advantage of anaconda is that installs a standard python environment with numerous packages like numpy, scikit, etc.  If you use julia (which is what I use), you will need to install the [latest julia distribution](https://julialang.org) and the [IJulia package](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).  It is also possible to use Matlab, which has it's own notebook environment, but you should instead install the matlab kernel in jupyterlab (google \"jupyterlab matlab kernel\").\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many guides to getting started with jupyter notebooks on the web.  I encourage you to look around and let me know if you find some that are particularly helpful.  [Here is just one example](https://towardsdatascience.com/7-essential-tips-for-writing-with-jupyter-notebook-60972a1a8901).  \n",
    "At this point, I would advise against getting too carried away with style and customization.  Focus on doing what's required for the assignments.  I would, however, recommend that you take the time to learn the keyboard commands for notebooks and code editing.  Minimizing your use of the mouse and menus will greatly improve your productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are most suitable for the exploration and development of short functions.  When your programs become more complex or more difficult to debug, it is usually more efficient to write and debug your code in a traditional IDE like [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we do not recommend a specific plotting library, as there are numerous choices, and which one you prefer depends on factors like what you are already familiar with, what you're interested in learning, or the functionality you need.  For python, a common choice is [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).  In julia, the [Plots.jl package](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) provides a standard interface to several different backends.  You should feel free to explore others."

    "- show the equations for the pdf and the joint pdf on their own separate lines\n",
    "- write the product in both the general form as the product of functions, and in explicit form, where the product is pushed into the exponent.  You should have two equations and put them on separate lines using the latex align environment.\n",

    "- an annotation that displays the numerical value of the likelihood to 3 digits.\n",
