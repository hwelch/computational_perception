    "Write a function `genwaveform(N=100, α=0.1, A=1, σ=1)` to generate a waveform that is a linear combination of a sparsely occurring events and additive Gaussian noise. Here, we assume the events are fixed amplitude impulses that occur within a single sample.  The observed waveform, therefore, is a linear combination of the Gaussian background noise and these discrete events.  The parameters specify the waveform length `N`, the event probability `α`, the event amplitude `A`, and noise standard deviation $\\sigma$.  Assume the noise mean is zero.  The values listed are defaults.  The event probability specifies the probability of an event occurring within a sample.  Assume the events are independent.  The function should return a tuple of the resulting waveform and array of the event locations as indices.\n",

    "\n",
    "(Comment on terminology: The term \"signal\" can refer either to an individual event or the collection of events as a whole.  The waveform is the signal plus the noise.  Note that \"signal\" is sometimes used loosely to refer to the observed waveform, rather than the waveform without the noise.  This is because the signal itself cannot be observed directly, only inferred.  The term \"underlying signal\" is often used to emphasize the component of the waveform without the noise.)"
